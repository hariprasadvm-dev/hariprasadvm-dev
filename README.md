## 🧭 About Me  
As an aspiring engineer in the automotive domain, I’m enthusiastic about developing intelligent vehicle systems — from sensor fusion algorithms and perception modules to virtual XiL/HiL test benches and embedded software. My experience spans from sensor‐data analysis to software development for thermal‐comfort systems in German OEMs, and I enjoy working at the intersection of simulation and real-vehicle validation.

## 🚀 Featured Projects  
Here are some of my recent impactful repos:

### 🔧 [Virtual HiL Testbench](https://github.com/hariprasadvm-dev/virtual-hil-testbench)  
A Virtual Hardware-in-the-Loop (HiL) Testbench for testing an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system in a simulated environment.
- Modular, containerized framework emulating vehicle dynamics, sensors, and controller logic.
- Qt-based GUI for live visualization, tuning PID parameters, and interacting with the simulation.
- Built with Python, Flask (backend), C++17/Qt6 (GUI), Docker & REST API communication.
- Each subsystem runs in its own Docker container for flexibility and scalability.
- Demonstrates simulation-driven development for automotive control systems.

### 📷 [YOLOv3-Object-Detection](https://github.com/hariprasadvm-dev/yolov3-object-detection)  
A TensorFlow-based implementation of YOLOv3 for real-time object detection in images and videos.
- Single-pass detection: Frames detection as a single regression problem for speed and efficiency.
- Supports image and video inference: Enables detection in both static images and live video streams.
- Modular design: Includes separate modules for loading weights, performing detection, and utility functions.
- Pre-trained weights: Utilizes pre-trained weights for COCO dataset classes, facilitating quick deployment and fine-tuning.
